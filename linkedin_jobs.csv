Door jouw leergierige houding kun je snel meedraaien in het team en ben je altijd op de hoogte van de nieuwste technieken. Team NEVO vormt, samen met zeven andere teams, de Netcapaciteit & Inzicht Planning en Performance keten en is verantwoordelijk voor oplossingen die inzicht bieden, waardoor Enexis iedereen altijd toegang kunt geven tot energie. Dit doen we met veel energie en een gezonde dosis humor. Het team is verantwoordelijk voor het ontwikkelen en innoveren van het Enexis netrekenplatform, waarmee wij Enexis meer inzicht geven in wat de impact van de energietransitie op het energienet is. Wij leveren grootschalige capaciteitsberekeningen op basis van voorspellingen en modellen, die Enexis in staat stellen om analyses te doen over hoe we het energienet het beste en slimste kunnen uitbreiden voor lange termijn investeringen. Dit is de broninformatie voor onze grootste uitdaging: de energietransitie. Momenteel zijn we ook hard aan het werk om ervoor te zorgen dat op kortere termijn, het energienet zo efficiënt mogelijk benut kan gaan worden en hiervoor inzichten te ontwikkelen. Om deze uitdagingen het hoofd te bieden, organiseren we het werk in agile teams en pakken we vraagstukken multidisciplinair op. Verantwoordelijkheden zijn zo laag mogelijk in de organisatie belegd en elk team is gezamenlijk verantwoordelijk voor de uitgevoerde opdrachten. We maken optimaal gebruik van de aanwezige kennis en vaardigheden van medewerkers en bieden mogelijkheden om deze te vergroten. Door onze 'BizDevOps' teamsamenstelling zijn we zowel uitvoerend als richtinggevend binnen het netrekendomein.

Ben bekwaam in het begrijpen van complexe productiecode en kunt zelfstandig proof of concepts ontwikkelen en deze samen met het team in productie brengen. Gezien de uitdagingen en nieuwe technologieën die de energietransitie met zich meebrengt, is affiniteit met dit domein belangrijk. Bijvoorbeeld samen met het team toekomstige belastingen op te stellen, algoritmes voor inpassingen te maken, en flexcontracten te modelleren en door te rekenen, klinken jou als muziek in de oren. Een proactieve houding, heldere communicatie, de bereidheid om uit je comfortzone te stappen, en een positieve, verbindende instelling zijn essentieel in ons multidisciplinaire NEVO-team.
